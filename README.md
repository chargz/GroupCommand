# GroupCommand


Run a single linux command on a list of machines, via SSH. 
## Installation:
  - pip is needed. You can install this with `sudo apt-get install python-pip`
  - Run `pip install pexpect`
  - Run `python groupcommand.py` and follow the instructions.
  

# Note:

  SSH via .pem files is not supported yet. I am currently working on this and will be available soon.
